Introduction
============

The main purpose of this repository is to support the estimation of foot orientation and trajectory during walking, 
using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and pressure sensors embedded in smart socks. 
The system is designed to enable detailed gait analysis for individuals affected by Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 
providing accurate measurements of stride length, stride duration, and other spatiotemporal metrics.  
By combining IMU and GPS data, the solution aims to deliver reliable mobility assessments in real-world conditions, 
supporting both clinical evaluation and rehabilitation monitoring.
